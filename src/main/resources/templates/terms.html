            Welcome to MooDrop. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use
            of the MooDrop website and peer-to-peer file sharing platform. By accessing or
            using MooDrop, you agree to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms.
            If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must discontinue use
            of the service immediately.
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-subtitle mt-4">1. Description of Service</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            MooDrop provides a browser-based peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing platform
            that enables direct device-to-device file transfers using modern web technologies.
            Files are transmitted directly between connected users and are not stored
            on MooDrop servers. The service is provided for convenience and informational purposes only.
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-subtitle mt-4">2. Eligibility</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            By using MooDrop, you represent that you are at least 13 years of age and
            legally capable of entering into a binding agreement. If you are using
            the service on behalf of an organization, you confirm that you have the
            authority to bind that organization to these Terms.
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-subtitle mt-4">3. Acceptable Use</h4>

        </p>

        <p class="info-text">

        <h4 class="section-subtitle mt-4">6. Security Disclaimer</h4>
