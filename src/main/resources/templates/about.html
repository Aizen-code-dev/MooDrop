        <p class="info-text mt-4">
            MooDrop is a modern, browser-based peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing platform
            built to make digital file transfers simple, fast, and completely private.
            In a world where most file-sharing services rely on cloud storage and third-party
            servers, MooDrop takes a different approach — direct device-to-device communication
            without storing your data anywhere.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            Traditional file-sharing systems require users to upload files to remote servers
            before they can be downloaded by another device. While convenient, this model
            introduces storage limits, upload delays, privacy risks, and long-term data exposure.
            MooDrop eliminates these concerns by creating a secure, encrypted connection
            directly between two devices using modern browser technology.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            Our platform allows users to transfer documents, images, videos, compressed files,
            project folders, and large media files in real time. Because files move directly
            from sender to receiver, transfers are often faster and significantly more private
            than traditional cloud-based systems.
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-subtitle mt-4">How MooDrop Works</h4>

        <p class="info-text">
            MooDrop is powered by WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication), an advanced web
            technology that enables secure peer-to-peer connections directly between browsers.
            When a user generates a Remote ID and connects to another device, a secure
            encrypted communication channel is established instantly.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            Unlike conventional systems that temporarily store files on servers,
            MooDrop does not host or retain transferred content. Files travel directly
            between devices through encrypted data channels. Once the session ends,
            the connection closes automatically and no file data remains stored on our infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            During transmission, files are protected using AES-based encryption standards.
            This ensures that data cannot be read or intercepted by unauthorized parties.
            The encryption process happens automatically in the background without requiring
            technical knowledge from the user.
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-subtitle mt-4">Why We Built MooDrop</h4>

        <p class="info-text">
            Many modern file-sharing platforms require account creation, email verification,
            cloud uploads, subscription plans, or strict file size limits. These additional
            steps slow down the process and create unnecessary barriers for users who simply
            want to send files quickly and securely.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            MooDrop was built to remove these obstacles. Our goal was to create a lightweight,
            instant-access file transfer tool that works entirely in the browser without
            requiring installations, sign-ups, or data storage.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            By eliminating server storage, MooDrop reduces the risks associated with data breaches,
            centralized database hacks, and long-term exposure of sensitive files. Your content
            stays between you and the connected device — nowhere else.
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-subtitle mt-4">Privacy & Security First</h4>

        <p class="info-text">
            Privacy is the foundation of MooDrop’s architecture. We do not store transferred files.
            We do not inspect file contents. We do not build user profiles. Since transfers are
            peer-to-peer, there is no central database holding your documents.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            Security measures include encrypted communication channels, temporary session
            identifiers, and automatic termination of inactive connections. This minimizes
            potential attack surfaces and ensures that sessions remain short-lived and secure.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            While no internet technology can guarantee 100% absolute security, MooDrop is designed
            with industry-standard encryption protocols and secure communication layers
            to provide a high level of protection during every transfer.
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-subtitle mt-4">Cross-Platform Compatibility</h4>

        <p class="info-text">
            MooDrop works seamlessly across modern desktop and mobile browsers. You can transfer
            files between PC to PC, mobile to PC, PC to mobile, or even between two smartphones.
            The platform is fully responsive and adapts automatically to different screen sizes.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            Because MooDrop runs entirely within the browser, no additional software,
            plugins, or extensions are required. This reduces compatibility issues and
            makes the service accessible to users across different operating systems.
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-subtitle mt-4">Performance & Efficiency</h4>

        <p class="info-text">
            By removing cloud uploads from the process, MooDrop significantly reduces
            transfer latency. Files do not need to travel to a remote server and then
            back down to the receiving device. Instead, they move directly between
            connected endpoints.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            This architecture not only improves speed but also reduces bandwidth
            usage on centralized infrastructure. As a result, MooDrop remains
            lightweight and efficient while maintaining strong performance.
        </p>

        <h4 class="section-subtitle mt-4">Our Vision</h4>

        <p class="info-text">
            Our long-term vision is to make secure digital communication accessible
            to everyone. As privacy concerns grow and data ownership becomes more
            important, decentralized technologies play a critical role in shaping
            the future of the internet.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            MooDrop aims to contribute to a safer digital ecosystem where individuals
            retain full control over their data. We believe that users should not have
            to sacrifice privacy for convenience.
        </p>
