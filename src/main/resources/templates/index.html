    <!-- INFO -->
    <section id="howItWorks" class="panel glass-panel info-card">
        <h3 class="section-title">How It Works</h3>

        <p class="info-text">
            MooDrop is built on modern peer-to-peer (P2P) browser technology that allows two devices
            to communicate directly with each other without uploading files to a central server.
            Unlike traditional cloud-based file sharing services where files are first stored on
            a remote server before being downloaded, MooDrop creates a temporary direct connection
            between the sender and the receiver.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            This means your files travel straight from your device to the recipient’s device.
            At no point are they permanently stored, monitored, or processed by an external server.
            The connection is established securely using real-time communication protocols,
            ensuring fast and efficient data transfer.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-title">Step 1: Generate Your Unique Remote ID</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            When you open MooDrop, the system automatically generates a temporary Remote ID.
            This ID acts like your secure address for that session. You can share this ID
            with someone you trust who wants to send you files. The ID is session-based and
            changes after refresh or reconnection, which improves safety and prevents reuse.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-title">Step 2: Connect Securely</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            To begin transferring files, the sender enters the recipient’s Remote ID and clicks
            Connect. Once verified, a secure handshake is established between both devices.
            This handshake confirms that both parties are online and ready to exchange data.
            The connection remains active only for the duration of the transfer.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-title">Step 3: Select and Send Files</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            After connection, you can choose one or multiple files from your device.
            MooDrop supports multi-file selection, allowing efficient bulk transfers.
            Each file is split into small encrypted chunks and transmitted sequentially
            to ensure smooth and reliable delivery even on unstable networks.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-title">Step 4: Real-Time Progress Tracking</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            During the transfer process, MooDrop displays a live progress indicator
            for each file. This helps users monitor upload and download speed in real time.
            If a connection interruption occurs, the system can retry sending failed
            chunks automatically without restarting the entire transfer.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-title">Step 5: Transfer Completion</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            Once the transfer is complete, the sender sees a “Sent” confirmation and
            the receiver can instantly download the received file to their device.
            The session automatically closes after inactivity, ensuring no open
            connections remain active longer than necessary.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            Because MooDrop does not rely on server-side storage, transfer speeds
            are primarily dependent on the internet connection quality of both devices.
            For best performance, users should use a stable Wi-Fi or wired connection
            and avoid switching networks during transfers.
        </p>
    </section>


    <section id="security" class="panel glass-panel info-card">
        <h3 class="section-title">Security</h3>

        <p class="info-text">
            Security and privacy are at the core of MooDrop’s design. Unlike many
            traditional file-sharing platforms that temporarily store files on servers,
            MooDrop uses a direct peer-to-peer connection model. This ensures that your
            files remain between you and the intended recipient only.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-title">Peer-to-Peer Architecture</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            In a peer-to-peer system, devices connect directly without routing files
            through centralized storage servers. This reduces the risk of data breaches,
            unauthorized access, or server-side vulnerabilities. Since MooDrop does not
            permanently store files, there is no central database containing user uploads.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-title">End-to-End Encryption (AES-256)</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            MooDrop implements strong encryption standards to protect your data
            during transmission. All file data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption
            before being transmitted. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with 256-bit
            keys is widely recognized as a highly secure encryption method used
            by financial institutions and security-focused systems worldwide.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            Encryption ensures that even if network traffic were intercepted,
            the data would remain unreadable without the proper decryption key.
            This adds an additional layer of protection against potential
            cyber threats and man-in-the-middle attacks.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-title">Temporary Session-Based Connections</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            Every connection in MooDrop is temporary and session-based.
            Once a transfer is completed or the page is refreshed,
            the connection closes automatically. This prevents lingering
            open sessions that could otherwise be exploited.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-title">No Personal Data Collection</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            MooDrop does not require account creation, login credentials,
            or personal identification details. The platform operates without
            collecting or storing personal user data. This reduces exposure
            to privacy risks and ensures that your activity remains private.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-title">Connection Verification</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            Transfers only occur when the correct Remote ID is entered.
            This verification step ensures that files are shared intentionally
            between trusted devices. Users are encouraged to share Remote IDs
            only with trusted contacts and avoid posting them publicly.
        </p>

        <h4 class="sub-title">Failure Handling & Reliability</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            MooDrop includes automatic retry mechanisms for failed file chunks.
            If the connection drops temporarily due to unstable internet,
            the system attempts to resend missing portions instead of
            restarting the entire transfer. This improves both reliability
            and efficiency.
        </p>

        <p class="info-text">
            While MooDrop provides strong technical safeguards, users should
            always follow best security practices such as using secure networks,
            keeping browsers updated, and sharing IDs responsibly. Security is
            strongest when both technology and user awareness work together.

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="sub-title">2. Does MooDrop store my files on a server?</h4>
            <p class="info-text">
                No. MooDrop does not store, save, or archive any files on external servers.
                All transfers occur directly between connected devices using peer-to-peer
                communication. Once the transfer is completed and the session ends,
                no data remains on the platform.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="sub-title">3. Is MooDrop secure for transferring sensitive files?</h4>
            <p class="info-text">
                MooDrop uses strong encryption standards such as AES-256 to secure
                file data during transmission. Additionally, connections are temporary
                and session-based, reducing exposure risk. However, users should always
                ensure they share Remote IDs only with trusted individuals and use
                secure internet connections when transferring sensitive files.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="sub-title">4. Do I need to create an account to use MooDrop?</h4>
            <p class="info-text">
                No account creation or login is required. MooDrop is designed to be
                simple and privacy-focused. You can start transferring files immediately

            <h4 class="sub-title">5. Is there a file size limit?</h4>
            <p class="info-text">
                MooDrop does not enforce a strict file size limit from the server side
                because files are not uploaded to a server. However, transfer speed and
                stability depend on the internet connection of both devices. Large files
                may take longer depending on network conditions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="sub-title">6. Why is my transfer slow?</h4>
            <p class="info-text">
                Since MooDrop relies on peer-to-peer communication, transfer speed
                depends on both the sender's upload speed and the receiver's download speed.
                Using stable Wi-Fi, avoiding network switching, and minimizing background
                downloads can improve performance.

                MooDrop uses WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology to establish
                a direct peer-to-peer connection between browsers. This allows real-time
                encrypted file transfers without relying on traditional cloud storage systems.
                WebRTC is widely supported by modern browsers and enables secure,
                low-latency communication between devices.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="sub-title">12. Does MooDrop require software installation?</h4>
            <p class="info-text">
                No installation is required. MooDrop runs entirely in your web browser.
                There is no need to download applications, extensions, or plugins.
                Simply open the website, generate a Remote ID, and start transferring files.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="sub-title">13. Can I transfer files across different operating systems?</h4>
            <p class="info-text">
                Yes. MooDrop works across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS devices
                as long as a modern browser is available. Because it operates within the browser,
                it is platform-independent and does not require system-specific software.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="sub-title">14. Is MooDrop better than email attachments?</h4>
            <p class="info-text">
                For large file transfers, MooDrop is often more efficient than email.
                Email providers usually limit attachment sizes and may compress files.
                MooDrop allows direct transfers without compression or storage limits,
                depending on your internet capacity.

        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="sub-title">15. How does MooDrop protect user privacy?</h4>
            <p class="info-text">
                Privacy is a core principle of MooDrop. Since files are never stored
                on external servers and transfers occur directly between devices,
                the platform does not have access to the content being shared.
                Temporary session-based connections further reduce data exposure.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="sub-title">16. Can MooDrop be used for business purposes?</h4>
            <p class="info-text">
                Yes. MooDrop can be used by teams and professionals who need
                quick, secure file transfers without cloud dependency.
                However, users should ensure compliance with company
                data policies when sharing sensitive business information.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="sub-title">17. What should I do if my browser blocks the connection?</h4>
            <p class="info-text">
                Some browsers or firewalls may block peer-to-peer connections.
                Make sure you allow required permissions and disable strict
                firewall restrictions temporarily if necessary.
                Using updated browser versions ensures better compatibility.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4 class="sub-title">18. Will MooDrop add premium features in the future?</h4>
            <p class="info-text">
                MooDrop is continuously evolving. Future updates may introduce
                enhanced features, improved transfer optimization, or optional
                advanced tools. Any updates will prioritize privacy,
                performance, and user experience.
